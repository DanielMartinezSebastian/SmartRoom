## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: Server Components for data fetching, Client Components for interactivity
- **State Management**: React useState hooks
- **Data Fetching**: Prisma ORM via Server Components
- **Mutations**: Fetch API to existing REST endpoints
- **Validation**: Zod schemas (already existed)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4
- **Animations**: GSAP via AnimatedCard component

### Security
- ✅ Authentication check (Supabase session)
- ✅ Authorization check (ADMIN role)
- ✅ Server-side validation
- ✅ Client-side validation
- ✅ Delete confirmations
- ✅ No SQL injection (Prisma ORM)
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities
- ✅ CodeQL scan passed: 0 alerts

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: passes (only pre-existing warnings)
- ✅ Code review: approved
- ✅ Follows existing patterns
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing code

## Usage

### For Admin Users:
1. Log in as ADMIN user
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Click quick action buttons:
   - "Manage Rooms" → `/dashboard/rooms`
   - "Manage Products" → `/dashboard/products`
   - "Manage Users" → `/dashboard/users`
4. Use search and filters to find items
5. Click "Create" to add new items
6. Click "Edit" to modify items
7. Click "Delete" to remove items (with confirmation)

### For Developers:
- See `/app/dashboard/README.md` for detailed documentation
- All API endpoints already exist and are working
- Validation schemas in `/lib/validations/`
- Extend components as needed
- Follow existing patterns
